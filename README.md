# Calculating block averages

In this exercise we are going to calculate block averages.  

The input file `energies` that I provided you with contains 1000 values for the energy.  For this exercise I want you to calculate:

* The average over the first 100 energies in this file
* The average over the second 100 energies in this file
* The average over the third 100 energies in the file 
* and so on.  

The final result should thus be a list containing 10 values for the average energy.  I have setup a list with 10 elements that you can use to hold these averages.  The list is called `av_eng` and, as you can see, the final lines in the code on the left will create a figure that show you the 10 values that you have calculated for the average energy.
